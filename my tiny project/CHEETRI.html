    ABOUT CHEETRI :
</h1>
<p>
    The term "Chhetri" refers to one of the major ethnic groups in Nepal. Chhetris are traditionally associated with the Kshatriya varna, which is considered the warrior or ruling class in the Hindu caste system. However, it is important to note that Nepal officially abolished the caste system in 1963, and since then, the identification as Chhetri is more of an ethnic and cultural affiliation rather than a strict caste classification.

    Here are some key points about Chhetris:

Population and Distribution: Chhetris are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nepal, comprising approximately 15-20% of the country's population. They are predominantly found in the hilly and mountainous regions of Nepal, particularly in the western and central parts of the country. Chhetri communities can also be found in neighboring regions of India, such as Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh.

Historical Background: Historically, Chhetris were associated with the ruling and warrior classes. They played a significant role in the formation of the Gorkha Kingdom, which later unified Nepal in the late 18th century under the leadership of King Prithvi Narayan Shah. Chhetris have a long history of military service and have traditionally held prominent positions in the Nepalese Army.

Social Status and Occupation: Chhetris have historically held a high social status and occupied positions of power and authority. In addition to military service, Chhetris are engaged in various professions, including politics, civil service, business, and agriculture. Over time, with increased access to education and changing social dynamics, Chhetris have diversified their occupations and are now involved in various sectors of the economy.

Culture and Traditions: Chhetri culture is rich in traditions and customs. They have their own language called Khas Kura, although Nepali is widely spoken and understood. Chhetri festivals, such as Dashain and Tihar, hold great significance and are celebrated with enthusiasm. Traditional attire, music, and dance are also important elements of Chhetri culture.

It is important to note that while Chhetris hold a significant presence in Nepal, the country is diverse and consists of numerous ethnic and caste groups, each with its own distinct traditions, cultures, and languages. The recognition and respect for this diversity contribute to the multicultural fabric of Nepal.

    As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the exact percentage of Chhetri population in Nepal and worldwide may not be readily available due to various factors such as demographic changes, lack of comprehensive global data, and the complexity of identifying individuals solely based on ethnic or caste affiliations. However, I can provide you with approximate figures based on the available information.

1. Chhetri Population in Nepal: Chhetris are one of the largest ethnic groups in Nepal. It is estimated that they constitute around 16-20% of the total population of Nepal. These figures may vary slightly depending on the source and the methodology used for population estimation.

2. Chhetri Population Worldwide: It is challenging to provide an accurate estimate of the Chhetri population worldwide since the majority of Chhetris are concentrated in Nepal. However, due to migration and the presence of Nepali diaspora communities in various countries, Chhetris can be found in small numbers in countries like India, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other parts of the world.

It's important to note that population figures can change over time due to various factors such as birth rates, migration, and changing self-identifications. For the most up-to-date and precise information regarding the Chhetri population in Nepal and worldwide, it would be best to refer to recent demographic studies or government census data from the respective countries.
